# Encryption Challenge

Create a program that, when given a message from a file and an integer key, encrypts the message by getting the ASCII number for each character, adding it to the key and its index, and then converting it to binary.

The program should also be able to decrypt any encrypted messages it creates.

Try to make the program as fast as possible in the language of your choice.
